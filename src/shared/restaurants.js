Jef and his two brothers serve as the food visionaries in the kitchen. First and foremost, the brothers focused on flavor. That has followed them to Cascadia Grill where they have eschewed the fancy-looking meal for flavor-filled casual food. Cascadia Grill is a comfy corner haunt with handmade burgers, shakes & other nostalgic eats, plus an extensive tap list. Popular dishes include: Garlic Steak, Smoked Trout, Italian Sausage Burger and Bacon Wrapped Sirloin.',
